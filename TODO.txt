New API request: 
 - When Creating a player all option to set initial rating and record (if not sent set to 1200 and 0-0-0).
 - Retrieve list of games for a player 
    - Request attribute:
        - number of games
        - Get wins/loss/both

 - Post create Game, if Draw is true is the winner field Ignored?
 - Can UpdateRatings automatically run when a new game is created?
    - I cannot get UpdateRatings to work. It looks like I can create a game fine, but I don't see the players records change.

    public class Tournament
    {

        */
